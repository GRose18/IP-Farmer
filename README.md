I would suggest using VSCode for this. Use the mkdir command to make a directory called "hack". Move sshconnection.html, launch.json, and server.js to the hack directory. Then create a .txt file using the "touch" command called log.txt. In terminal, or in the VSCode terminal, navigate to the hack directory. (cd hack). Then, to make sure that server.js is up in running, use node server.js. It should show: Server is running on http://localhost3000. And that's it! Launch the html file and enter in the credentials. It should put them in log.txt. *AGAIN, DO NOT USE THIS FOR ANYTHING BUT EDUCATIONAL AND HARMLESS PURPOSES! HACKING IS A FELONY, AND IF YOU DO NOT GET WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE OTHER PERSON FOR AN SSH CONNECTION, IT IS ILLEGAL.*
